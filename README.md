We are using Node.js
In order to setup, first SSH into the OSU server via the terminal.
Then clone this repository
Then, when inside the project repository, run this command: npm install mysql2 express nodemon forever express-handlebars

I set the port number to 5000! So when running 'npm run development/production' and you go to http://classwork.engr.oregonstate.edu:YOUR_PORT_NUM
make sure you replace the port number appropriately in the URL.
