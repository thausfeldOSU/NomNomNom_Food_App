# NomNomNom_Food_App
CS340 Group 77 Project

We are using Node.js
In order to setup, first SSH into the OSU server via the terminal.
Then clone this repository
Then, when inside the project repository, run this command: npm install mysql2 express nodemon forever express-handlebars

I set the port number to 5000! So after running 'npm run development/production' when on the OSU server, go to
http://classwork.engr.oregonstate.edu:5000

Side note, other classmates seem to be using this port as well. 5001 worked for me, so switched it to that for now. Feel free to switch to something else; its in the app.js file

If you run this from your local machine, go to
http://localhost:5000
If you do run from localhost, just know that the home page is probably all that will work because the database is on OSU servers.
